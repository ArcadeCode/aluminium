I'm sorry, but `assets/logo.ico` was made by a Artificial Intelligent, beause I don't have the many to send into this project. `logo.svg` was made using a ICO to SVG converter and `banner.svg` is a modified version of `logo.svg` made by me.

I know the importance of Icon Designer but I don't have many funds for this project. But if you want to contribute to this project, you can send me a new version of `logo.svg` and `banner.svg` made by a Human and I will honored to use it as the main logos for Aluminium.

> NOTE: Prefer if you want to update this assets to use `SVG` format.

> HOW TO CONTRIBUTE: Send a ISSUE to add you icon and I will discuss with you for adding this logo to the projet.
